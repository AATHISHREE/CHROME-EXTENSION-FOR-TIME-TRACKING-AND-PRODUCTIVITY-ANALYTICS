📌 DESCRIPTION:

As a Task 2 project for the CodTech Full Stack Development Internship, I built this Time Tracker Chrome Extension. It automatically tracks the time spent on each website and provides simple productivity analytics. The extension runs in the background, stores usage data, and displays it in a clean popup interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – structure for the popup

CSS3 – styling the popup UI

JavaScript (ES6) – logic for tracking and storing time

Chrome Extension APIs – background scripts, tab listeners, local storage

🔗 Data Platform / API Used

Chrome Storage API – for storing website usage locally

Chrome Tabs API – to monitor tab changes and updates

Data Tracked:

Website domain (e.g., youtube.com)

Time spent per domain (in seconds)
